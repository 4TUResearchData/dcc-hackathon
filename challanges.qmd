## Challenge 1 - API Documentation

This one is our work in progress. Contribute to the [`djehuty` documentation](https://djehuty.4tu.nl/) by adding info about the (v2) API. 

In this challenge you will expand [Section 5](https://djehuty.4tu.nl/#x1-430005) of the documentation. This section already provides information about some of the endpoints, but it is still under construction. 

:::{.callout-note title="Where to start?"}
In the `djehuty-24.8` folder, find file 

```{default}
src/djehuty/web/wsgi.py

```

In the file, you can find a procedure `url_map` belonging to the class `ApiServer`. This procedure serves as a dictionary between URIs and procedures. Look for sections `V2 API`.  Confront this section with the [documentation](https://djehuty.4tu.nl/#x1-430005) and add sections that are missing, following the documentation convention.

To change the documentation files, go to 

```{default}
doc/api.tex
```

## Challenge 2 - GitHub/Gitlab Release integration

This one might sound familiar! The challenge is based on an [issue](https://github.com/4TUResearchData/djehuty/issues/20) raised after last meeting between the DCC and 4TU.ResearchData technical team.

Work on an automated workflow to connect code hosting platform (GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket/Savannah/Forgejo) releases with 4TU.ResearchData.

## Challenge 3 - (Advanced) Git big repo results in big memory consumption

This one was *bugging* us for a while.
